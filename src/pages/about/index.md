How it all began…..
I moved to Brooklyn, New York two days after graduating college. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, the eccentricity and electricity of the city fueled me and made me feel at home. But shortly after beginning my work as a teacher in an underserved, low-income elementary school, I began to experience symptoms of anxiety like severe hypochondria and panic attacks. Desperation led me to yoga just at the same time that I began seeing a therapist. Together, those two practices helped me find a calm and whole center, even as my world spun around me. I continued to develop mindfulness practices, joining a Buddhist organization and eating a vegan diet. I even spent a year in South Korea, teaching, learning about the Buddhist tradition, and regulating my emotions.

Taking some time off!
Eventually, back in New York, I realized that I was still experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression and that I needed to make big some changes. Ultimately I quit my job, moved to Salt Lake City, and committed to a slower pace of life with wellness as my first priority.

Community Care:
Several years ago, I had a conversation with a friend about something I had learned in therapy. It resonated with him profoundly and allowed him to make huge shifts in his life. I realized then that there is value in sharing what we have learned with others and so I created @vegandthecity (linked) to create a raw, honest space to discuss what I’d been dealing with: mental health, wellness, yoga, meditation, and burnout. Eventually upon moving to Utah, I took a big risk and started a podcast based on my experiences as well! (link to take some time off!)

I hope that my by sharing my journey, we can begin to build conversation and community. Together, we can get mindful and be well.
